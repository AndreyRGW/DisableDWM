Place the "disabledwm.bat" and "enabledwm.bat" files in C:\Windows\System32. Pick which version you need, the Windows 10 version or the Windows 11 versions.
Place the "powerrun.exe" file in C:\Windows\System32 as well, please do not run the .bat files directly as you will have insufficent permissions.
When you run the script it will tell you to restart the system, so please restart the system.
